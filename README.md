# SampleSignUP
=>I have used POM(Page Object Model) along woith pagefactory approach.
=>I have made a maven project.
=>I have not hard coded any data inside java program, I have used separate JSON file for data.
=>Java Files details are "FacebookSingnUpTest.java", "ElementActions.java","FacebookSignUpPage.java","Base.java"
=>For all the repetitive action which is used multipe times I have created a common method, and calling whereever required instead of writing new method again and again.
=>Runner file is "testng.xml"
=>This project can be downloaded and can run directly through testng.xml, it will call the java test file, and other file will be called accordingly.
